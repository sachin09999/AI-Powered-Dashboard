## 🤖 AI Features

This dashboard leverages the power of **Genkit** to provide three core AI functionalities, located in `src/ai/flows/`:

1.  **`summarize-data-trends.ts`**: Analyzes a given dataset (in CSV format) to provide a natural language summary of key trends and answer user questions.
2.  **`recommend-chart-types.ts`**: Suggests the most effective chart types (e.g., bar, line, pie) to visualize the provided data, along with reasoning.
3.  **`detect-anomalies.ts`**: Scans the dataset for significant outliers or unusual patterns and flags them with a title, description, and severity level.
